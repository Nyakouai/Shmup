    //  You can jump right into the menu if you want and still play the music, but you'll have a few
    //  seconds of delay while the mp3 decodes - so if you need your music to be in-sync with your menu
    //  it's best to wait for it to decode here first, then carry on.
    
    //  If you don't have any music in your game then put the game.state.start line into the create function and delete
    //  the update function completely.
